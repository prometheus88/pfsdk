## 🏗️ Architecture

The SDK follows a **proto-first architecture** where Protocol Buffer definitions are the single source of truth for all generated code across multiple languages and platforms, including smart contracts.

See the [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed information.
